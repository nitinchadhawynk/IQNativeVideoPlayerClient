     *  of the current item because the requirement for an external protection mechanism is not met by the
     *  current device configuration. It is highly recommended that clients whose content requires external
     *   protection observe this property and set the playback rate to zero and display an appropriate user
     *   interface when the value changes to YES. This property is key value observable.
     
     *   Note that the value of this property is dependent on the external protection requirements of the
     *   current item. These requirements are inherent to the content itself and cannot be externally specified.
     *   If the current item does not require external protection, the value of this property will be NO.
